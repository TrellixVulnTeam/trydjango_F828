# trydjango
Basic web application developed in django.

### Brief Descripton
This is an ongoing project where I develop a simple web application. As of now, the project is at its very early stage where I am building the skeleton of the project.

The final goal will be to provide the user to be able to input values 
into a form and get a prediction for prescribed model. 

### More information
For steps to replicate the project, please follow summary.txt on main page of the project. 

All the files associated with the main project application are inside src.
